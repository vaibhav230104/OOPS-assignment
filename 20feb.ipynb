    "# Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# GET and POST are HTTP methods used for communication between a client (such as a browser) and a server.\n",
    "# - GET: Requests data from a specified resource. Parameters are sent via the URL. It's less secure and has limitations on data size.\n",
    "# - POST: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource. Parameters are sent in the request body. It's more secure and allows larger data to be sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. Why is request used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "# 'request' in Flask is used to handle incoming requests from clients. It allows access to incoming form data, query parameters, file uploads, etc., sent in the HTTP request. It provides a way to interact with the data sent by the client to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Why is redirect() used in Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "# 'redirect()' in Flask is used to redirect the user to a different route or URL. It's commonly used after form submissions or to direct users to a different page after performing certain actions on a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Templates in Flask are HTML files containing placeholders for dynamic content. They allow for the creation of dynamic web pages by injecting data into HTML. The 'render_template()' function in Flask is used to render these HTML templates by passing dynamic data from the Python code to the HTML template for rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Create a simple API. Use Postman to test it. Attach the screenshot of the output in the Jupyter Notebook.\n",

    "        return jsonify({'message': 'This is a GET request to the API'})\n",
