    "# Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flask is a micro web framework for Python, used to build web applications. It is minimalistic and lightweight, providing tools and libraries to create web applications quickly and easily. Advantages of Flask include:\n",
    "# - Lightweight: Simple and easy to get started with.\n",
    "# - Flexible: Offers freedom and flexibility in building web applications.\n",
    "# - Extensible: Provides a wide range of extensions to add functionalities.\n",
    "# - Integrated Development Server: Comes with a built-in development server.\n",
    "# - Jinja2 Templating: Supports Jinja2 templating for flexible and dynamic content rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’. Attach the screenshot of the output in\n",
    "# Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    return 'Hello World!!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "# For the screenshot, you can run this code in a Python environment and capture the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "# App routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to view functions. It's achieved using the @app.route decorator in Flask. We use app routes to define different URL endpoints and their corresponding functionalities or responses in the web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. Create a “/welcome” route to display the welcome message “Welcome to ABC Corporation” and a “/”\n",
    "# route to show the following details:\n",
    "# Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "# Location: India\n",
    "# Contact Detail: 999-999-9999\n",
    "# Attach the screenshot of the output in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "def welcome():\n",
    "    return 'Welcome to ABC Corporation'\n",

    "    return '''Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "Location: India\n",
    "Contact Detail: 999-999-9999'''\n",

    "# Similar to Q2, to capture the output, you can run this code and take a screenshot of the displayed content.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. What function is used in Flask for URL Building? Write a Python code to demonstrate the working of the\n",
    "# url_for() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The url_for() function in Flask is used for URL building. It generates URLs based on endpoint names.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "from flask import url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "with app.test_request_context():\n",
    "    print(url_for('hello_world'))\n",
    "    print(url_for('welcome'))\n",
    "    print(url_for('company_details'))\n",
