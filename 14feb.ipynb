    "# 1. Multithreading in Python\n",
    "# Multithreading in Python refers to a concurrent execution of threads within a single process. Threads allow different parts of a program to run concurrently. It's used to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks like network operations or handling multiple user inputs.\n",

    "# Complexity: Synchronization and coordination between threads can lead to complex code.\n",
