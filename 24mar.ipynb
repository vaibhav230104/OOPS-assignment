    "# Q1. What are the key features of the wine quality dataset? Discuss the importance of each feature in predicting the quality of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Wine Quality dataset contains various physicochemical features (e.g., acidity, pH, alcohol content) and the quality rating of wines. Features like alcohol content, acidity levels, pH, volatile acidity, and density are crucial as they significantly influence the taste, aroma, and overall quality of wine. These factors are important predictors as they impact the chemical composition and characteristics of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. How did you handle missing data in the wine quality dataset during the feature engineering process? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different imputation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Common techniques for handling missing data in the Wine Quality dataset might include mean imputation, median imputation, or KNN imputation. Mean imputation replaces missing values with the mean of the observed values. Median imputation uses the median, while KNN imputation fills missing values based on similarity with other data points. Advantages of mean/median imputation are simplicity and ease of implementation, but they might introduce biases. KNN imputation considers relationships between features but can be computationally expensive.\n",

    "# Q3. What are the key factors that affect students' performance in exams? How would you go about analyzing these factors using statistical techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Factors influencing student performance could include socioeconomic status, study time, parental education, class attendance, etc. Statistical techniques like regression analysis, correlation analysis, and ANOVA could help analyze these factors. Regression could show the relationship between variables, correlation could depict the strength and direction of relationships, and ANOVA could assess differences in performance among groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. Describe the process of feature engineering in the context of the student performance dataset. How did you select and transform the variables for your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Feature engineering in the Student Performance dataset might involve transforming categorical variables into numerical ones (using encoding techniques like Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding), scaling numerical variables for better model performance, and creating new features derived from existing ones (like combining study time and failures to create a new feature indicating academic effort).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Load the wine quality dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify the distribution of each feature. Which feature(s) exhibit non-normality, and what transformations could be applied to these features to improve normality?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. Using the wine quality data set, perform principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features. What is the minimum number of principal components required to explain 90% of the variance in the data?\n",
