    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "# MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-based database that stores data in JSON-like documents. Non-relational databases like MongoDB are suitable when dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data, providing more flexibility and scalability. MongoDB is preferred in scenarios requiring flexible schemas, real-time analytics, or high scalability, as it allows easier horizontal scaling and accommodates evolving data structures more efficiently than traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB features include:\n",
    "# - Flexible Schema: Documents can have varying structures.\n",
    "# - Scalability: Horizontal scaling by distributing data across servers.\n",
    "# - High Performance: Support for indexing and query optimization.\n",
    "# - Replication & High Availability: Data redundancy for reliability.\n",
    "# - Rich Query Language: Support for various query types.\n",
    "# - GridFS: Storage of large files exceeding BSON document size limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",

    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",

    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "# Create a database named 'my_database'\n",
    "my_db = client['my_database']\n",
    "# Create a collection named 'my_collection' in 'my_database'\n",
    "my_collection = my_db['my_collection']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record,\n",
    "# and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "my_collection.insert_one({\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30})\n",
    "# Insert multiple records\n",

    "\n",
    "# Print all inserted records using find()\n",
    "for record in my_collection.find():\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to\n",
    "# demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The find() method is used to query documents in a collection based on specified criteria.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "for record in my_collection.find({\"age\": {\"$gte\": 30}}):  # Find records where age is greater than or equal to 30\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The sort() method in MongoDB is used to arrange retrieved documents in a specified order (ascending or descending) based on a field.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Sorting documents based on 'age' field in ascending order\n",
    "sorted_records = my_collection.find().sort(\"age\", 1)\n",
    "for record in sorted_records:\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - delete_one(): Removes a single document that matches the specified criteria.\n",
    "# - delete_many(): Removes multiple documents that match the specified criteria.\n",
    "# - drop(): Drops an entire collection from the database.\n",

    "# Delete a document\n",
